This project has been inspired by applications such as WhatsApp and Slack, the idea behind this project is to be able to create a minimum viable product of a real-time messaging web application using websockets technology, deployed in a real production environment.

* **Nginx** configured proxy pass to **Daphne ASGI** and **Gunicorn WSGI**.
* Using **Redis Channel** to manage all websockets layers
* Configured `/static/` folder on Nginx to serve all static files like **CSS, Javascript, Images**...
* All connections **HTTP and WebSockets** are working over **TLS/SSL**.
* Using **csrf token** on login page to avoid middleware attacks.
* **Wrapped WebSocket** connection over the module AuthMiddlewareStack.
* Using a pretty GUI to help user to interact with app. 
* You can also manage all chats from **Django Administrator panel**
* Using **JSON** files to make messages perisent in **sqlite database**

## How To Deploy

Clone repository and after change the name of the folder to app/:

    $ git clone https://github.com/NgomezKS/Django-message-app-with-Nginx-Daphne-and-Gunciorn

    $ ls 
    Django-message-app-with-Nginx-Daphne-and-Gunciorn/
    
    $ mv Django-message-app-with-Nginx-Daphne-and-Gunciorn/ app

    $ ls 
    app/


Put the .sock and .service files from the `services/` folder in systemd `/etc/systemd/system/` and then run:
     
    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

    $ sudo systemctl start gunicorn.socket
    $ sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.socket

    $ sudo systemctl start daphne.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable daphne.service

    $ sudo reboot

You should also put a script in `/etc/init.d` to start Redis after a reboot and also to make sure Daphne and Gunciron are working
   
    #! /bin/bash

    service gunicron start
    service daphne start
    docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:6.2.3

    exit 0

Copy the files from `nginx_conf/` to configure the Nginx configuration
   
    $ sudo cp app/nginx_conf/sites-available/spacechat  /etc/nginx/sites-available/spacechat
    $ sudo cp app/nginx_conf/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/

    $ sudo service nginx restart


Now we activate Python virtual enviroment and generate all static files.
   
    $ source app/spacechat/venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ app/spacechat/manage.py collectstatic

Now you can search https://172.10.10.10/, this is the default user to access.
  
    User: admin 
    Password: p4ssword!

## To do ideas
* Add support for multiple languages or at least for the most common ones
* Add an complex sistem of levels and permissions
* Add support to send images and videos
* Detect if an user is already logged from another device
* Encrypt messages in the database 
* Also encrypt all messages while they are being processed on the server
* Add private chats between users

Im not going to following developing and maintain this project anymore, if you wanna use it be some purpose be free to dot it.
